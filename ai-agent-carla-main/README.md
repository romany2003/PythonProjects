# Developing and Testing a Vehicular AI Agent


This project will create a realistic simulation environment using the CARLA Simulator to mimic real-world traffic scenarios. Students will design and implement scenarios incorporating multimodal data of egocentric and allocentric car views. The egocentric view data will be produced by the car, while the allocentric view data will be collected from the infrastructure RGB and LiDAR sensors available. They will develop an AI agent that can interact with human drivers, providing real-time information and alerts that enhance the driving experience.
